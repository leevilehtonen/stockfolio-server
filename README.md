## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is an open-source, document database designed for ease of development and scaling.
